# Netmask Privacy Plugin for Firefox
Automates the mangagement and setting of hidden firefox privacy parameters for maximum browser safety.

This is not yet approved for the Firefox plugin marketplace. To install manually, download the complete
package. Open the FireFox extensions window, and click settings->install add-in from file.

Browse to this directory, find the .xpi file, and load it. Loading the extension does not require a restart of the browser.

Once installed, the add in will help give you fine grained control and advice to manage the hidden parameters of the browser to improve overall privacy.

Some of the settings that are manageable:
 * Block WebRTC, which can be used to get a real IP address, even when using a VPN.
 * Disable sending of information to third parties like Google (for virus checking)
 * Disable sockets and pings (which can break some applications)
 * Set up general parameters for protection, and preventing sites from bypassing some filters.

 Here is a screen shot of the installed plugin:
